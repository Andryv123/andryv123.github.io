			<p style="margin:10px;text-align:center">Acid is my return to making maps for videogames. Two years ago, I made a map called de_acid, we will refer to it as Acid 2021. I thought, and still think, that it was a small, simple and effective defusal map. I then later made an entirely inferior version of the map called de_acid2, which I will also call Acid2 2021 (just in case :P). These are the only screenshots remaining online of what they look like, I apologise for the low quality as I can't take new picture as I lost the source files ages ago.<br><br>(LEFT IMAGE: Acid 2021, RIGHT IMAGE: Acid2 2021)</p><br><img src="https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/220-90_60290dcd068f9.jpg" style="width:48%;margin:10px"><img src="https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/220-90_602a54f2c649e.jpg" style="width:48%;margin:10px"><br><p style="margin:10px;text-align:center">You may be thinking that these maps look practically the same (and I wouldn't blame you in the visuals department) but that couldn't be further from the truth. The map was a poorly designed, unoptimized, rushed NIGHTMARE. It wasn't fun to play, it ran poorly on almost any piece of hardware, and was big for the sake of being, big. I realised my mistake very quickly and took the map down hours after playing stating that I was "Reworking the map to release later to make it more fun." It seems I forgot about this however due to how ashamed I was with the amazingly poor quality of Acid2 2021 that I haven't touched the Acid maps since then.</p><p style="margin:10px;text-align:center">Acid2 2021 was a map created because I wanted to make a map on a grander scale with no knowledge as to how I could do that well. Acid 2023, is going to change that. I want to make an innovative map on a 4-10 player scale that has unique gameplay elements, such as a massive glass floor over a pit of acid and, well, you'll see what else when I release the map. I'm going to make sure not to rush it and have it in the most fun state possible, I hope you enjoy it when it has released. See you then.</p>
